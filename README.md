# Face-mask-detection

### This repo is the copy of <a href = "https://github.com/mountechsolutions/face-mask-detection">this</a> repo in which me and my team members created a face mask detection model. This project is part of MLDSN workshop which started in Jul 29, 2020 and ended in 3rd August,2020.
